This project covers creating a new Laravel application and working with routes and Blade templates. It includes setting up authentication using Laravel Breeze, working with migrations, running raw SQL queries, using the query builder and Eloquent ORM. It also includes accessors, mutators, image storage, and caching.

The main feature is a Help Ticket system where users can create and store tickets with file uploads, update and delete models, use Laravel notifications, and manage "has many" relationships. The project also includes deployment using MezoHub.
